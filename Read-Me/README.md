# Horiseon SSS, Inc. Refactored Website

## About the Project:

We were given a premade html and css file with the necessary images provided. Our task was to refactor the code to make it more accessible.

**Changes**: Added a descriptive title, refactored repetitive css rules, added css comments to increase readability, changed div elements to semantic html elements and removed unnecessary classes from those elements. I also took the liberty to try implementing some media queries to reformat the website at smaller screen widths.

**Finished, Refactored Website**:
